/* SHORTCODES
 * All the Shortcodes I created for ease of use of this site.
 * In order to keep it all a bit more organized, I decided to place all the "modules" (a module handles a shortcode-group) in the shortcodes folder to make this file less cluttered
 * I might build this all in a modular plugin later, but I don't know yet.
